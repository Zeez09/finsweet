          Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure<br/>
          about how to get the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design<br/>
          wanted to build a Figma plugin for the larger design community. The plugin is called the<br/>
          Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX copies cataloged and categorized with a voice and tone<br/>
          variation ranging from plain, casual to playful. The intention to build this Figma plugin<br/>
          originated from our Medium blog post, â€˜Designing voice and tone for error messages.
